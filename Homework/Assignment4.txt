// I used VARCHAR(255) for the file paths of video_content, image_content, 
// and thumbnail since the string for these file paths could be very long and
// are unknown. The file paths could be very deep in subdirectories and
// I used 255 for VARCHAR because it's the largest number of characters that 
// are counted with an 8-bit number so it maximizes the use of the 8-bit 
// count. 255 characters is also the the maximum length of VARCHAR in many 
// databases. Worst case scenario, if the file path for the any of the 
// contents are longer than 255 characters, then an error/warning will be 
// generated if MySQL is running in strict mode.
